Node.js async patterns let us pick the right abstraction.

Among the three methods—Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await—the Async/Await method is the easiest and most efficient for modern JavaScript development. 
Callbacks work but they become messy very quickly because you nest functions inside each other, which leads to “callback hell” and makes code hard to read, debug, and maintain. 
Promises improved the situation by removing nested callbacks, but they still require
.then() and .catch(), which can get long and less readable when you chain multiple asynchronous steps. 
Async/Await is the best option because it reads like normal synchronous code, even though it is still asynchronous.
 It is clean, short, and avoids callback nesting and long Promise chains. It also makes error handling much simpler with try/catch.
